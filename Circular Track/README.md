Circular Track

There is a circular track of length 
𝑀
consisting of 
𝑀
checkpoints and 
𝑀 bidirectional roads such that each road has a length of 
1 unit.



Chef is currently at checkpoint 
𝐴
and wants to reach checkpoint 
𝐵. Find the minimum length of the road he needs to travel.

Input Format:

First line will contain 
𝑇, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

Each test case contains a single line of input, three integers 
𝐴,
𝐵,
and 
𝑀 - the initial checkpoint, the final checkpoint, and the total number of checkpoints respectively.

Output Format:

For each test case, output the minimum length Chef needs to travel.

Constraints:
