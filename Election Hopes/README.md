## Election Hopes

The elections in Chefland have concluded, and the results are in!

Chef received 
𝑋 votes, and his rival Chefu received 
𝑌
.

Chef thinks he dominated the election if and only if he received at least double the number of votes Chefu received.
Did Chef dominate the election?

### Input Format:

The only line of input contains two space-separated integers 
𝑋 and 
𝑌 — the number of votes received by Chef and Chefu, respectively.

### Output Format:

Print a single line containing the answer: either "Yes" or "No" (without quotes), depending on whether Chef dominated the election or not.

Each letter of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, the strings No, no, NO, and nO will all be treated as equivalent.

### Constraints:
