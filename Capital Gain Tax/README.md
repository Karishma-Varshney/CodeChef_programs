## Capital Gain Tax
The annual budget for ChefLand has been announced and people are concerned about the modification in capital gain tax.

Given that the capital gain tax changed from 
X%
to 
Y%, find whether it has INCREASED, DECREASED, or remained the SAME.

### Input Format
The first and only line of input consists of two space-separated integers 
X and 
Y denoting the previous and new value of capital gain tax.
### Output Format
Output on a new line:

- INCREASED, if the capital gain tax has increased;
- DECREASED, if the capital gain tax has decreased;
- SAME, if the capital gain tax remained the same.
You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings SAME, same, Same, and sAmE would be considered identical.
