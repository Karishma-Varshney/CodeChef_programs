𝑋. Find the total cost of the groceries Chef buys.

Input Format:

The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇, denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.

--The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers 
𝑁 and 
𝑋 — the number of items and the minimum freshness value an item should have.

--The second line contains 
𝑁 space-separated integers, the array 
𝐴, denoting the freshness value of each item.

--The third line contains 
𝑁 space-separated integers, the array 
𝐵, denoting the cost of each item.

Output Format:

For each test case, output on a new line, the total cost of the groceries Chef buys.
