## Valentine Gifts

Chef is planning to gift something to Chefina on each of the

days of valentine week. He has a total budget of 
𝑋
rupees.

Find whether he can plan a series of gifts such that:

Each gift has a positive value;

The value of a gift is at least twice the value of previous gift.

Note that we do not consider any previous gift for the first gift, and thus the first gift can be of any positive value.

### Input Format:

The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇, denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single integer 
𝑋, denoting the budget of Chef.

### Output Format:

For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if Chef can plan a series of gifts such that each gift is at least twice the value of previous gift. Otherwise, print NO.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).
