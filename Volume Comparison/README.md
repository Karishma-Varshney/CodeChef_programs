# CodeChef coding Q26

## Volume Comparison
Alice has two objects:

1. A cuboid with length 
A units, height 
B units, and width 
C units.

2. A cube with an edge length of 
X units.

Alice wants to know which of the two objects has a larger volume, or if their volumes are equal.

### Input Format
The first and only line of input will contain four space-separated integers 
A, 
B, 
C and 
X, the length of the cuboid, the width of the cuboid, the height of the cuboid, and the length of the edge of the cube.
### Output Format
Print a single line containing the string:

- "Cuboid", if the volume of the cuboid is greater than the volume of the cube.
- "Cube", if the volume of the cube is greater than the volume of the cuboid.
- "Equal", if both objects have equal volume.
Print the string without quotes.

You can print each character of the output in either uppercase or lowercase.
For example, the strings Cube, CUBE, cube, and CuBe are considered identical.
