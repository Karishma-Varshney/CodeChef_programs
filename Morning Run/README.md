## Morning Run

Chef wants to run at least 
1000 meters to reach his fitness goal.
There's a rectangular park nearby, with a length of 
𝑋 meters and a width of 
𝑌 meters.

Can Chef complete his goal by running one loop around the park? (Loop meaning running the entire path around the edge of the park.)

### Input Format:

The only line of input will contain 
2 space-separated integers 
𝑋 and 
𝑌, the length and the width of the rectangular park.

### Output Format:

Print "YES" if Chef will be able to complete his fitness goal, otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You may print each character of the output in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints:
