RCB vs CSK

In the recent RCB vs CSK match, RCB batted first and scored 
𝑋 runs while CSK batted second and scored 
𝑌 runs.

It is known that RCB qualifies to the playoffs if they win by at least

Input Format:

The only line of input contains 
2
integers 
𝑋 and 
𝑌- the final scores of RCB and CSK respectively.

Output Format:

Output RCB if RCB managed to qualify to the playoffs, otherwise output CSK.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings RCB, rCb, rcb, and rcB will all be treated as identical).
